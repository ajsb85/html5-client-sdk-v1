Use the HTML5 Client SDK to create simple integrations of Mobile Connect into web applications.

Note this SDK is recommended for applications with low security requirements, as it is not really possible to keep user information or API credentials confidential within a client side only environment.

For higher security applications it is recommended to use server side invocation of key API calls, for example by using the Mobile Connect Java or PHP SDKs.
